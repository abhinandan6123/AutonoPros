**1. Project Overview**
This project aims to design a dynamic predictive analytics model for estimating ride and delivery pricing in real time. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this solution adapts to factors such as distance, duration, traffic, weather, and demand surges, providing accurate and scalable pricing models for logistics and ride-sharing platforms.

**2) Factors to Predict Prices for DataSet Creation**
To develop an accurate pricing model, we identified critical factors influencing ride and delivery pricing. These include:
**Distance and Duration**: Key drivers of base fare and operational costs.
**Traffic and Weather Conditions**: Dynamic variables impacting travel time and risks.
**Time of Day and Demand Patterns**: Surge pricing during peak hours or high-demand periods.
**Service Type and Customization**: Economy, premium, or specialized services.
**Delivery Attributes**: Package weight, size, and special handling requirements.

**3) Data Collection and Integration**
We utilized real-world data sources to construct a robust dataset:
**Distance and Duration**: Extracted via Google Maps Distance Matrix API.
**Weather Conditions**: Collected using OpenWeatherMap API for real-time data.
**Synthetic Variables**: Traffic levels, service categories, and surge multipliers were modeled using industry benchmarks.
This comprehensive dataset ensures representation of diverse real-world scenarios.

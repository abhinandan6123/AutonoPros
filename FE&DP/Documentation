Feature Engineering and Data Preparation Process
In this project, Feature Engineering (FE) and Data Preparation (DP) are crucial steps for improving model performance and ensuring that the dataset is ready for predictive modeling. Below is a brief summary of the steps and processes involved:

1. Missing Value Handling
Imputation was applied to both the feature set (X) and target variables (y) to fill missing values. For categorical variables, the most frequent value was used, while for numerical targets, the mean value was used.
2. Categorical Encoding
Label Encoding was performed on categorical columns to convert them into numerical values. This transformation is essential for models that require numeric inputs.
3. Feature Scaling
Standardization was applied to numerical columns using StandardScaler to bring all features onto the same scale, improving model convergence and accuracy.
4. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
PCA was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining 95% of the variance. This helps in decreasing the complexity and improving computational efficiency.
5. Mutual Information Analysis
Mutual Information Regression was used to evaluate the relationship between each feature and the target variables (trip_duration_min, total_fare, surge_multiplier, traffic_index). This step helps in understanding the feature importance and can aid in feature selection.
6. Final Processed Dataset
After performing all the above steps, the dataset was combined with the PCA-transformed features and saved for further modeling tasks.

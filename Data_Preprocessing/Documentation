Detailed Explanations of Each Step

**Load the Dataset:**

Loads data and reviews structure, column data types, and missing values.
Saves the raw dataset for reference before modifications.

**Handle Missing Values:**

Numeric columns: Fills missing values with the median to reduce the effect of skewed distributions.
Categorical columns: Fills missing values with the mode or most frequent value.

**Correct Data Types:**

Converts date-related columns to datetime format.
Converts columns with few unique values to category type for memory optimization.


**Feature Engineering:**

Creates trip_duration by calculating the difference between start and end times.
Extracts day_of_week and month for trend analysis.
Adds an efficiency feature (distance divided by trip duration) to capture trip efficiency.


**Outlier Detection and Handling:**

Uses the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and clip outliers for numeric columns.

**Sanitize and Normalize Data:**

Standardizes column names to lowercase with underscores.
Normalizes numeric columns using z-score normalization to standardize the scale.


**Save Cleaned Data:**

Saves the processed datasets into a data/ folder with meaningful filenames.

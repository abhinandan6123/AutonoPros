The documentation provides a comprehensive breakdown of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the dataset used in the Real-Time Pricing Predictor project. Here's a brief summary:

***Introduction:*** 

Explains the purpose of the EDA, focusing on factors influencing pricing.

Data Loading and Inspection: Discusses the dataset's structure, key columns (e.g., distance, duration, demand, price), and initial observations.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Confirms the absence of missing values and proper data types, ensuring readiness for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Highlights variability in key metrics like price, distance, and duration, and notes potential outliers.

Data Visualization: Uses scatter plots, box plots, and line graphs to show relationships between variables such as price vs. distance and demand trends.

Correlation Analysis: Identifies strong, moderate, and weak correlations between variables like distance, duration, demand, and external factors.

*Feature Engineering*: Introduces new metrics (e.g., price per kilometer, travel difficulty score) to improve data utility for predictive modeling.

Conclusion: Summarizes insights, emphasizing primary price drivers (distance, duration, demand), and notes external factors like weather and traffic as secondary.

The documentation is structured to provide clear insights into the EDA process and its impact on understanding pricing patterns.
